## helloworld.py
Basically just a script that prints out "Hello world!". Tested under Linux.

## superhot.py
Reference to the 2016 game, SUPER**HOT**. Prints "SUPER", waits a second, prints "HOT" and loops.

## textrepeater.py
Repeats the user input.

### Troubleshooting
If something is wrong with the script and you are in Windows, remove `#!/usr/bin/env python`, since this line adds compatibility for Linux. Else, submit an issue. *Note that I'm a poopy head at Python, so I may not help you completely.*
